Ideas, resources and discussions

Welcome to my Github profile,

I'm an aspiring data scientist interested in applying computational methods to investigate cultural and social phenomena. 

Most of my current work involves project based learning where I apply new techniques I've learned to explore some interesting datasets. In the coming months I'm aiming to explore my own dataset relating to a topic of personal interest.  

Constructive feedback is always appreciated.

Chet
